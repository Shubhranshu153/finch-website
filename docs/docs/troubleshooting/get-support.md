# Getting Finch Support

Finch is an open source project, available license free to all users. There are
no licensing tiers or commercial agreements required to use and run Finch.

## Creating a Support Bundle

Before reaching out to the team, it would be a great help if you created a
support bundle. This creates a zip archive providing information about the
environment, and the logs of the various Finch components.

```bash
finch support-bundle generate
```
