## finch completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(finch completion zsh); compdef _finch finch

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	finch completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_finch"

#### macOS:

	finch completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_finch

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
finch completion zsh [flags]

      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
